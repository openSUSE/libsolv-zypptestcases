These testcases were converted from the old sat-solver repository's
test suite. They are mostly used for regression testing.

Many of those tests no longer test what they were originally written
for.

Do make libsolv use them in 'make test', go in the 'test' directory
of libsolv and do a 'git clone' of this repo. Then re-run cmake.
